### I've Made this Journey Before and You Probably Haven't. 

When you complete a journey, looking back, sometimes you have learned things. If I were to start my journey over again, I would do things differently from the beginning, knowing what I know now. I want to impart some of my knowledge to you, to save you the time and frustration of learning by trial and error the way that I did, and hopefully you will get started more quickly than me.

### What is the Destination?

Collaboration and code review are valuable skills and GitHub is a popular place for open-source code. You can use these skills in an unlimited number of situations.  

The destination is:
* Greater autonomy
* If you are a student: being prepared for your studies and career
* If a developer: perhaps you can get a promotion
* In general: you can make cool stuff, make choices that influence product

### How My Journey Began

When I first signed up for GitHub, I felt a bit intimidated. My account sat unused for months.

### Collaborative Development Models

There are two collaborative development models: 
* “Shared Repository” Model (usually an organization but could also be a user account repo)
* “Fork and Pull” Model

How you contribute to a repo will depend on whether you have read/write access. If you have read/write access to a repo, you can contribute directly to the repo, which is the "Shared Repository" Model. If you do not have read/write access to a repo, you will need to fork the repo to your user account, which is called the "Fork and Pull" Model.

### Doing Multiple Things at Once

There is an overall theme to this talk. The theme is about doing multiple things at once. The way to do that is through something called "branches". If you learn to use branches, you've won half the battle. As you take on more responsibility, branches will give you the freedom to do multiple things at the same time:

### Branches

Regardless of which collaborative development model you use, the process for dealing with branches is very similar. The two main differences are that if you are using the "Fork and Pull" Model, you need to fork the repo before you clone it, and you need to check a box when you make the pull request if you want the maintainers to be able to change your pull request.
